## About

Save a meal is a web application that aims to reduce food waste by connecting customers with businesses. This full-stack project was created over 2 weeks as a final project by students at [Sigma Labs](https://sigmalabs.co.uk/).

The high level features of the web application are:
* A landing page UI based on a professional design. 
* Registration as either a customer of business. 
* User log in, authentication and cookie-based sessions. 
* Search page; enter a postcode and get the nearest participating restaurants. (Try EC2A 4EG).  
* Bookings; customers are able to book one order a day.
* Accept orders and user reviews. 
* Account page; giving the user the ability to change their details.

## Usage and Installation

Clone this repository locally and run [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) install on both the client and server directory. Then run npm start on both to open two local development servers:
- Port 3000 : React frontend. 
- Port 8080 : Node backend. 

You also need to setup a local Postgres server. The instructions to do so are [here](https://brief-fan-5e0.notion.site/Postgres-Setup-422c9a41dbd44c3da8fc1c08feb0ff28).

## Roadmap

Future plans for this project include:

* Fixing deployment bugs. (CSS issues, search page loading screen). 
* Adding a proximity filter in the Search Page. 
* Mobile responsive frontend.
